    <p>LensS Collections Intelligence answers questions about collections performance in plain language, from governed and certified data. It helps collections leaders and analysts understand performance against target, where recovery is falling short and which strategies and channels work. It <b>supports people's decisions</b>; it does not make decisions about individual customers, and it is not a forecasting tool.</p>

        <li>Deleting a conversation removes its messages; the monitoring log keeps the (already masked) question for audit.</li>

        <li>Strategy comparisons show <b>observed differences</b> between matched segments, not the uplift a change would cause.</li>
        <li>AI can misread a question or make mistakes. Check the quality badge, and the SQL under "How this answer was made", before acting.</li>
